Data sets
---------
Both data sets contain only mean and standard devaition measurements per subject's activity; in total 68 columns:
- 1 - Subject ID
- 2 - Activity performed by the subject
- 3:68 - Subject's measurement reading

"data" contains all reading, "summary" contains only calculated mean of readings (that might be little bit confusing; there are multiple mean reading in "data", summary takes that multiple reading and calculates a single mean)

Measurements
------------
Measurements in data sets come either from a gyroscope (Gyro) or accelerometer (Accel), provide either mean (Mean) or standard deaition (Std) of time (Time) or frequency (Freq) readings

For better understanding of the values generated by the script please refer to the documentation of the original data set.
